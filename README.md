# Mega-COV
This repository includes information about *Mega-COV*, the dataset first introduced in our recent paper ([Mega-COV: A Billion-Scale Dataset of 65 Languages For COVID-19](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06012)), currently published on ArXiv. We have also published a [Medium post](https://medium.com/@mumageed/billion-scale-investigation-of-covid-19-impact-on-human-communication-in-104-languages-874b5a37beac) about this work. Mega-COV is a billion-scale dataset from Twitter for studying COVID-19. The dataset is diverse (covers 234 countries), longitudinal (goes as back as 2007), multilingual (comes in 65 languages), and has a significant number of location-tagged tweets (~32M tweets). We release tweet IDs from the dataset, hoping it will be useful for studying various phenomena related to the ongoing pandemic and accelerating viable solutions to associated problems.

*We note that the data here is our second version and so it is a more recent version of the initial reelease we had when we first published the manuscript on ArXiv. We will soon add an updated version of the paper, reflecting the current data release.*

# Word clouds for hashtags of Mega-COV
Word clouds for hashtags in tweets from the top 10 languages in the data. We note that tweets in non-English can still carry English hashtags or employ Latin script.
